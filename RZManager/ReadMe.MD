# Data center manager (RZ-Manager)

*Read this in other languages: [Deutsch](Readme.de.md)

The data center manager (german: RZ-Manager) is an addon for the CMDB. It requires a data model, and it tests the CMDB at the start. If the data model or parts of it are missing, they will be created inside the CMDB, if the user has administrative rights.

The application copies all needed data during the start from the CMDB and then map them graphically as they would appear in the racks of a datacenter.

The application supports workflows like buying assets, mounting them, taking them into action and scrapping them at the end of the lifecycle.
